# Demo Mode Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete

### ðŸŽ¯ Features Implemented:

1. **React Context for Demo Mode**
   - Created `src/context/DemoContext.js` with demo state management
   - Provides `demoMode`, `enableDemoMode`, `disableDemoMode`, and `showDemoAlert` functions

2. **Demo Data Files**
   - `src/data/demoBuyers.js` - Static buyer/party data
   - `src/data/demoDashboard.js` - Dashboard statistics and payment data
   - `src/data/demoPayments.js` - Transaction and payment data

3. **Demo Banner Component**
   - `src/components/DemoBanner.js` - Shows "demo mode" banner with exit option
   - Appears at top of all screens when in demo mode

4. **Updated WelcomeScreen**
   - "Try Demo" button now enables demo mode and navigates to Home screen
   - Uses React Context to set demo state

5. **Updated Core Screens with Demo Support:**
   - **HomeScreen**: Uses demo data when `demoMode = true`
   - **PaymentsScreen**: Shows demo transactions and disables actions
   - **PartiesScreen**: Shows demo buyers and disables add/edit actions
   - **StaffScreen**: Disables attendance and interactive features
   - **MoreScreen**: Shows demo exit option and disables most features

6. **Updated Components with Demo Support:**
   - **PartyCard**: Disables call/message actions in demo mode
   - **TransactionCard**: Disables payment actions in demo mode
   - **DemoBanner**: Shows demo status and exit option

7. **Demo Mode Behavior:**
   - All "Add", "Edit", "Delete" actions show demo alert
   - API/database calls are bypassed - only local data is shown
   - Demo banner appears on all screens
   - "Exit Demo" functionality returns to Welcome screen

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:

1. **App.js**: Wrapped entire app with `DemoProvider`
2. **Context Usage**: All screens import and use `useDemoMode()` hook
3. **Data Switching**: Screens check `demoMode` flag to switch between real and demo data
4. **Action Blocking**: Interactive elements call `showDemoAlert()` when in demo mode
5. **Navigation**: Demo mode controls navigation flow appropriately

### ðŸŽ¨ User Experience:

1. **Entry Point**: "Try Demo" button on Welcome screen
2. **Visual Indicator**: Demo banner on all screens shows current mode
3. **Feature Blocking**: Clear alerts explain demo limitations
4. **Exit Strategy**: Easy "Exit Demo" button available in banner and More screen
5. **Data Consistency**: All demo data is realistic and consistent

### ðŸš€ Usage Flow:

1. User opens app â†’ sees Welcome screen
2. User taps "Try Demo" â†’ confirms in alert dialog
3. App sets `demoMode = true` â†’ navigates to Home screen
4. All screens now show demo data and demo banner
5. User can explore all features with sample data
6. Interactive actions show "disabled in demo mode" alerts
7. User can exit demo via banner or More screen
